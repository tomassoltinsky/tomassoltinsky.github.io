A late end to reionization at redshift $$z\simeq5.3$$ is consistent with observed spatial variations in the Ly$$\alpha$$ forest transmission and the deficit of Ly$$\alpha$$ emitting galaxies around extended Ly$$\alpha$$ absorption troughs at $$z=5.5$$. In this model, large islands of neutral hydrogen should persist in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) until $$z\simeq6$$. We use a novel, hybrid approach that combines high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with radiative transfer to predict the incidence of strong 21-cm forest absorbers with optical depths $$\tau_{21}>10^{-2}$$ from the diffuse IGM in these late reionization models. We include the effect of redshift space distortions on the simulated 21-cm forest spectra, and treat the highly uncertain heating of the pre-reionization IGM by soft X-rays as a free parameter. For a model with only modest IGM pre-heating, such that average gas kinetic temperatures in the diffuse IGM remain below $$T_{\rm K}\simeq10^2\,\rm K$$, we find that strong 21-cm forest absorption lines should persist until $$z=6$$. For a sample of $$\sim10$$ sufficiently radio-loud background sources, a null-detection of 21-cm forest absorbers at $$z\simeq6$$ with SKA1-low or possibly LOFAR should provide an informative lower limit on the still largely unconstrained soft X-ray background at high redshift and the temperature of the pre-reionization IGM.
