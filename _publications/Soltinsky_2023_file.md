Enhanced ionizing radiation in close proximity to redshift $z\gtrsim6$ quasars creates short windows of intergalactic Ly $\alpha$ transmission blueward of the quasar Ly $\alpha$ emission lines. The majority of these Ly $\alpha$ near-zones are consistent with quasars that have optically/UV bright lifetimes of  $t_{\rm Q}\sim10^5−10^7\,\rm yr$. However, lifetimes as short as $t_{\rm Q}\lesssim10^4\,\rm yr$ appear to be required by the smallest Ly $\alpha$ near-zones. These short lifetimes present an apparent challenge for the growth of $\sim10^9M_{\odot}$ black holes at $z\gtrsim6$. Accretion over longer time-scales is only possible if black holes grow primarily in an obscured phase, or if the quasars are variable on time-scales comparable to the equilibriation time for ionized hydrogen. Distinguishing between very young quasars and older quasars that have experienced episodic accretion with Ly α absorption alone is challenging, however. We therefore predict the signature of proximate 21-cm absorption around $z\gtrsim6$ radio-loud quasars. For modest pre-heating of intergalactic hydrogen by the X-ray background, where the spin temperature  $T_{\rm S}\lesssim10^2\,\rm K$ prior to any quasar heating, we find proximate 21-cm absorption should be observable in the spectra of radio-loud quasars. The extent of the proximate 21-cm absorption is sensitive to the integrated lifetime of the quasar. Evidence for proximate 21-cm absorption from the diffuse intergalactic medium within $2−3\,\rm pMpc$ of a (radio-loud) quasar would be consistent with a short quasar lifetime, $t_{\rm Q}\lesssim10^5\,\rm yr$, and would provide a complementary constraint on models for high-redshift black hole growth.
