I am a postdoctoral fellow in the field of Astrophysics/Cosmology at the [Tata Institute of Fundamental Research](https://www.tifr.res.in/) in the group of [Girish Kulkarni](https://theory.tifr.res.in/~kulkarni/). I did my PhD at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/astronomy/) mentored by [James Bolton](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~ppzjsb/) and [Nina Hatch](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/astronomy/NottICL/).

My research revolves around the Epoch of Reionization - a period of time after the first ever stars and galaxies formed and illuminated universe changing its evolution. I do this by modelling the 21-cm signal, which is a signature of the most abundant element in the universe - Hydrogen. I use this signal to explore the Intergalactic medium (material between the galaxies, large scale structures) and supermassive black holes. I am a member of the [Sherwood-relics simulation suite](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/astronomy/sherwood-relics/) team who develops cosmological simulations which I use to model the 21-cm signal. If you are interested in more details (and nice animations), please check my [research](https://tomassoltinsky.github.io//research/) page.
