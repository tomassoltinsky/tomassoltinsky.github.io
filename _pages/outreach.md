Besides the talks about my research to the audience from the astronomical community, I gave various outreach talks at my former high school - Gymnázium Pavla Horova in Michalovce, Slovakia. For example, one of the talks was titled "From LA to LA" in which I described my trajectory from my home village Lastomír (which we nickname LA) to study abroad program at Caltech in Los Angeles. I have shared my experience from this study abroad program at the University of Edinburgh when I became a student ambassador. This also led to me representing the University of Edinburgh at the parliamentary reception at Westminster.

I am also a mentor at the Slovak platform [GROWNi.sk](https://growni.sk/mentor/tomas-soltinsky?interests=V%25C3%25BDber%2520univerzity&page=3){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} providing consulations with volunteering professionals.

Currently, I am one of the organizers of the State of the Universe ([SOTU](https://theory.tifr.res.in/~sotu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) seminar series at the Department of Theoretical Physics at TIFR.
